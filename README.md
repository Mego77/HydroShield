# HydroShield 

###Mobile-Based AI-Powered Flood Prediction & Alert System
HydroShield is a mobile application that provides real-time weather updates and flood risk predictions, focusing on vulnerable areas like Alexandria, Egypt. It uses a machine learning model (Random Forest with 92% accuracy) and real-time environmental data from the OpenWeather API to estimate flood risks.

Built with Flutter and Firebase, the app includes features like live alerts, daily forecasts, community reporting, and bilingual support (English/Arabic). HydroShield aims to improve early warning systems and help users stay safe and prepared.



## Home Page 
The Home Page provides users with a quick overview of current weather conditions and flood risk in their area. It displays the current temperature, weather status (e.g., clear or rainy), and a 3-hour forecast. Below that, users can view key environmental indicators like humidity, wind speed, and the AI-predicted flood risk percentage. A prompt at the bottom allows users to report if they experienced flooding, helping improve future predictions through community feedback.

## Predicton Page
The Predict page provides a three-day forecast for Alexandria, displaying the expected temperature, weather condition, and flood risk for each day. The flood risk percentage is generated using a machine learning model trained on environmental data. This page allows users to stay informed about upcoming weather conditions and assess the likelihood of flooding in advance, helping them make safer and more informed decisions.
