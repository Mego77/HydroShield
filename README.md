# HydroShield 

### Mobile-Based AI-Powered Flood Prediction & Alert System
HydroShield is a mobile application that provides real-time weather updates and flood risk predictions, focusing on vulnerable areas like Alexandria, Egypt. It uses a machine learning model (Random Forest) and real-time environmental data from the OpenWeather API to estimate flood risks.

Built with Flutter and Firebase, the app includes features like live alerts, daily forecasts, community reporting, and bilingual support (English/Arabic). HydroShield aims to improve early warning systems and help users stay safe and prepared.



## Home Page 
The Home Page provides users with a quick overview of current weather conditions and flood risk in their area. It displays the current temperature, weather status (e.g., clear or rainy), and a 3-hour forecast. Below that, users can view key environmental indicators like humidity, wind speed, and the AI-predicted flood risk percentage. A prompt at the bottom allows users to report if they experienced flooding, helping improve future predictions through community feedback.
