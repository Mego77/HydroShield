Mobile-Based AI-Powered Flood Prediction & Alert System

## Home Page 
The Home Page provides users with a quick overview of current weather conditions and flood risk in their area. It displays the current temperature, weather status (e.g., clear or rainy), and a 3-hour forecast. Below that, users can view key environmental indicators like humidity, wind speed, and the AI-predicted flood risk percentage. A prompt at the bottom allows users to report if they experienced flooding, helping improve future predictions through community feedback.
